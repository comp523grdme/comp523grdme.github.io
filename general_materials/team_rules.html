        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>The best way to communicate is via slack. Phone numbers have also been exchanged for more urgent matters</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>How long do you wait for someone to arrive at a meeting before you begin without them?</h3>
        <p>It will be expected for team members to notify eachother (perferably via the group channel 
            in slack) as soon as they realize that they will be late. If someone is late without notice, 
            the group will wait for ~10 minutes before starting the meeting.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>If you need an answer to a question and someone does not respond, what assumptions can you make? 
            Consider, for example, that you sit down to get work done and need an answer; not working on it 
            could delay it for several days. Good practice is to indicate in the request when an answer is 
            needed and what the decision will be if no answer is received.</h3>
        <p>If a person does not respond to a question within a resonable amount of time (reasonable is 
            to be defined by the asker when stating when the answer is needed by) then the rest of the 
            group has the ability to make the decision without him.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>At what point should team members give a heads-up if they are not going to meet a deadline? 
            Perhaps 48 or 24 hours before it is due?</h3>
        <p>Generaly, as soon as possible. It won't be frowned upon to express doubt about meeting a 
            deadline early, as doing so might prompt a change of strategy that could avoid a problem. 
            Whenever possible, however, 24 hrs notice should be given.</p>
