        <h1>Development Environment</h1>
        <p> We will mainantain homogenaity in our development environment by using a linter that will automaticly conform code to
            a pre-defined style, and by using gulp (a JavScript compiler), which will combine different modules and files into 
            the distrobution file. Our code will be kept in sync using git.
