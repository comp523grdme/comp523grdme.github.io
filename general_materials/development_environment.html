        <h1>Development Environment</h1>
        <h2>Client Side (browser plug-in)</h2>
        <p> We will mainantain homogenaity in our development environment by using a linter that will automaticly conform code to
            a pre-defined style, and by using gulp (a JavScript compiler), which will combine different modules and files into
            the distrobution file. Our code will be kept in sync using git.
        </p>
        <h2>Server</h2>
        <p>
            We will use a vagrant box to develop the server. Even though node and npm already do a lot to manage versions of dependencies, 
            this will allow us to manage the version of node itself. This will also allow us to set up a local Mongo database instance easily.
