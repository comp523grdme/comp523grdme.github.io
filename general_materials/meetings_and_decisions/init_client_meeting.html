      <h1>Initial Client Meeting</h1>
      <h3>Discussed 3 Primary Objectives</h3>
      <ol type="1">
         <li>Stenography</li>
            <ol type="a">
               <li>brought up issue of compression in .jpg vs .png</li>
               <li>decided to begin with .png</li>
            </ol>
         <li>Perfect Forward Secrecy</li>
            <ol type="a">
               <li>Must address how to handle key exchanges in such a way that compromising one key will not compromise all messages</li>
               <li>Must decide if someone joining an encrypted group chat will be granted the ability to read past messages</li>
            </ol>
         <li>Tests</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Discussed Technologies To Be Used</h3>
      <ol type="1">
         <li>Javascript</li>
         <li>jquery</li>
         <li>git</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Wrap-Up</h3>
      <p>We will begin by developing a method to hide public keys in pictures using stenography. We will then move to
            implementing forward secrecy in a form that is to be determined by us. Time allowing, we will move to tests.
            Winston will be available via slack and google hang outs for any questions/problems/clairfications.</p>
