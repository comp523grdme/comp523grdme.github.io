      <h1>Concept Summary</h1>
      <h4>Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is important in part of modern security. Asymmetric crypto was the last major step and it allowed people that did not know one another to talk securely without sharing any prior secrets. PFS takes this one step further by tackling a major flaw in standard crypto: key leakage. If a key is ever leaked or bruteforced, all past messages and, if the user is unaware, future messages too can be vulnerable. One solution to this is to use larger and stronger keys to prevent attacks, but accidents will always happen. PFS adds an extra key exchange onto every message to increase the difficulty of an adversary compromising messages. This way because every message has a unique session key, you must brute force all of them. Going one step further, since these keys are meaningless after use, one time then done, PFS implementations delete the session keys to prevent leakage. This model of messaging has one more benefit, it mimics physical human conversations much better. Because like when you are talking to someone, it is not persistent like a facebook chat or email, PFS can actually give a more intuitive interface to a new user than these other technologies.</h4><!--202 words-->
      <h4>Steganography is a technique of storing data in pictures. It uses the least significant bit of information in the colour channels, so as to be imperceptible to the human eye. With this technique, we can leverage existing trust networks to tie together a coherent user profile. The current key-server model  for technologies like pgp has little notion of trust instead relying upon a web of trust generated by the  cross-signing of various user keys. This technique is outside of the scope of this document, however it is important to note that this method is not without its flaws. Steganography will allow us to instead place trust in services like Facebook, Twitter and Github  and allow a much more robust and decentralized network that can survive losing services in a way that the current Grd Me key-server cannot.</h4><!--137 words-->
