   <h1>Concept Summary</h1>
   <h4>Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) is important in part of modern security. Asymmetric crypto was the last major step and it allowed people that did not know one another to talk securely without sharing any prior secrets. PFS takes this one step further by tackling a major flaw in standard crypto: key leakage. If a key is ever leaked or bruteforced, all past messages and, if the user is unaware, future messages too can be vulnerable. One solution to this is to use larger and stronger keys to prevent attacks, but accidents will always happen. PFS adds an extra key exchange onto every message to increase the difficulty of an adversary compromising messages. This way because every message has a unique session key, you must brute force all of them. Going one step further, since these keys are meaningless after use, one time then done, PFS implementations delete the session keys to prevent leakage. This model of messaging has one more benefit, it mimics physical human conversations much better. Because like when you are talking to someone, it is not persistent like a facebook chat or email, PFS can actually give a more intuitive interface to a new user than these other technologies.</h4><!--202 words-->
