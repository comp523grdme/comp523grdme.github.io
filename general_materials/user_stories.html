      <h1>USER STORIES</h1>
      <h4>I am not very technical, would like to use encryption to share secrets and private information with encryption and need an easy, secure solution. This solution needs to use existing platforms, as I barely feel comfortable learning this encryption thing, and I would like it to integrate into email, facebook, twitter and all my existing internet things.</h3>
      <h4>I am concerned about my privacy. With the scale of dragnet surveillance and corporations monitizing my livelyhood, I would like to control where my data and information goes.</h3>
      <h4>I know how to use crypto and could write some software myself, so any solution that I would use needs to be verifiably secure, but I would like a tool to keep secrets that my parents can use.</h3>
